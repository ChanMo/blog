** Flycheck â€” Syntax checking for GNU Emacs

Flycheck is a modern on-the-fly syntax checking extension for GNU Emacs,
intended as replacement for the older Flymake extension which is part of
GNU Emacs. For a detailed comparison to Flymake see Flycheck versus Flymake.

It uses various syntax checking and linting tools to automatically
check the contents of buffers while you type,
and reports warnings and errors directly in the buffer,
or in an optional error list:

Out of the box Flycheck supports over 40 different programming languages
with more than 80 different syntax checking tools,
and comes with a simple interface to define new syntax checkers.

Many 3rd party extensions provide new syntax checkers and other features
like alternative error displays or mode line indicators.
