When you record a video in GNOME, the video will be aved in WebM format.
WebM is a good format for video compression, but is not as widely
supported as MP4. If you need to share your video with someone who does
not have a WebM player, you may need to convert it to MP4 format.

The following command will convert a WebM video to MP4 format:

``` {.bash}
ffmpeg -i input.webm output.mp4
```

However, this command will create a file that is larger and slower than
the original WebM file.

To fix this, you can use the following command:

``` {.bash}
ffmpeg -i input.webm -vf mpdecimate -c:a copy -vsync vfr ouput.mp4
```

This command will use the `mpdecimate` filter to reduce the frame rate
of the video. This will make the file smaller without sacrificing too
much quality.

The `-c:a copy` option tells ffmpeg to copy the audio stream from the
input file to the output file without re-encoding it. This will save
time and ensure that the audio quality is not lost.

The `-vsync vfr` option tells ffmpeg to use variable frame rate
encoding. This will ensure that the video plays smoothly on all devices.

To use this command, simply replace `input.webm` with the path to your
input video file and `output.mp4` with the path to the output video
file.

For example, to convert the video `my_video.webm` to MP4 format, you
would use the following command:

``` {.bash}
ffmpeg -i my_video.webm -vf mpdecimate -c:a copy -vsync vfr my_video.mp4
```

This will create a new video file called `my_video.mp4` that is smaller
and faster.
