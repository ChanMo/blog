Visualizing a SQLite database can be helpful for understanding the
design of the database, for identifying potential problems, and for
communicating the database design to others. There are a number of ways
to visualize a SQLite database, but one of the most convenient ways is
to use SchemaCrawler with Docker.

[SchemaCrawler](https://www.schemacrawler.com/index.html) is a free and
open-source database schema discovery and comprehension tool. It can be
used to generate ER diagrams, database documentation, and other reports
for a variety of databases, including SQLite.

To visualize a SQLite database using SchemaCrawler with Docker, you can
run this:

``` {.bash}
docker run \      
--mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/home/schcrwlr \
--rm -it \
schemacrawler/schemacrawler \
/opt/schemacrawler/bin/schemacrawler.sh \
--info-level=standard \   
--server=sqlite \
--database=db.sqlite3 \
--command=schema \
--output-format=png \
--output-file=graph.png \
```

This will generate an ER graph in PNG format, which will be saved to the
current directory.

You can also use the SchemaCrawler command-line interface to generate ER
graphs in other formats, such as SVG and PDF. To do this, simply change
the -outputformat argument to the desired format.

Here are some additional options that you can use with the SchemaCrawler
command-line interface:

    --infolevel=maximum: This will generate the most detailed ER graph.
    --showRelationships=true: This will show the relationships between the tables in the ER graph.
    --hideColumnDetails=true: This will hide the column details in the ER graph.

Once you have generated an ER graph, you can use it to visualize the
structure of your database and to identify any potential problems.

## Conclusion

Using SchemaCrawler with Docker is a convenient and reliable way to
visualize SQLite databases. SchemaCrawler is a powerful tool that can be
used to generate ER diagrams, database documentation, and other reports
for a variety of databases. Docker is a containerization platform that
allows you to package and deploy applications in isolated containers.

By combining SchemaCrawler with Docker, you can easily visualize your
SQLite databases on any system, regardless of the operating system or
the software that is installed on the system.
