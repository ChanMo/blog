Hi, my nickname is ChanMo and I am a software engineer. I am passionate about programming and I enjoy writing about my experiences with various programming languages and technologies.

I started this blog to share my knowledge and experiences with others. I hope that my blog will help people learn more about programming and that it will inspire them to explore these technologies on their own.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, biking, and spending time with my family and friends. I am also an avid reader and I love to learn new things.

I am excited to share my journey with you and I hope that you will join me on this adventure.

Here are some of my favorite programming languages and technologies:

- Python: A general-purpose programming language that is easy to learn and use.
- Emacs: A text editor that is highly customizable and extensible.
- ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  
I am a strong believer in open source software and I contribute to open source projects in my spare time.
I am always looking for new challenges and I am excited to see what the future holds for me. I hope that you will follow along on my journey and that I can inspire you to pursue your own dreams.
